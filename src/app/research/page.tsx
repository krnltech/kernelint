          Bangladesh is an agrarian country. Since 2000, agriculture is the
          powerful drivers of poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Nearly half of
          all the existing workers of the country are involve in agriculture.
          Despite frequent natural disaster, country has made commendable
          progress in agriculture over last 40 years. Bangladesh’s agricultural
          sector has benefited from a sound and consistent policy framework
          backed up by substantial public investments in technology, rural
          infrastructure and human capital. The recent advancement in
          agricultural sector is growing the country’s economy.

          Agriculture is increasingly depending more on data and intensive
          knowledge. Timely access to accurate information that is tailored to
          specific locations and conditions is critical in helping farmers make
          the most of their resources in often changing circumstances.
          E-agriculture, is about designing, developing and applying innovative
          ways to use ICTs in the rural domain, with a primary focus on
          agriculture. E-agriculture offers a wide range of solutions to some
          agricultural challenges. The Agricultural Development Team of the
          Kernel Foundation has taken some e-initiatives on problem solving
          solution of agriculture sector. Developing of the value chain and
          improving existing supply chain is our current focus. Agricultural
          diversification, innovative technology identification and ICTs
          (Information and communication technologies) solution to improve the
          current practices and the livelihood relating to this sector is out
          moto.

          Health care system of Bangladesh is facing problems to provide smooth
          health services for the booming population. Despite existing basic
          research organization, doing remarkable research on enteric and
          epidemic disease and getting outstanding research, research on health
          care service (clinical and non-clinical) remain out focus. High-impact
          interventions are still not reaching all of the low and middle income
          people in need. Our health care service and research activities (both
          clinical and non-clinical) focuses to find sustainable and innovative
          ways to strengthen the overall capacity and capability of the health
          sector. We advocate and implement programmatic and innovative
          solutions for strengthening the primary health care system to get
          soaring outcomes. We look for opportunities to maximize health
          financing to support program implementation and advancing
          evidence-based recommendations to accelerate the adoption of
          innovations by country decision-makers.
